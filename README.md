# GitHub-Viewer
GitHub Viewer is an iOS client to view GitHub profiles, repos, activity and more that I built to introduce myself to Swift and iOS development.

This app uses GitHub's API. Click [here](https://developer.github.com/v3/) for API documentation.

I also decided to use [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) to handle all network requests.
